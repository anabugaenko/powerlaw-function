# powerlaw-function: A Powerful Package for Analysing Heavy-Tailed Functions

`powerlaw-function` is a Python Package that extends the statistical methods developed by [Clauset et al. 2007](https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062) and [Virkar and Clauset. 2012](https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3524) for distribution fitting; i.e., fitting and determining whether a probability distribution of a single variable follows a power law.</b>
The `powerlaw` package is available at [powerlaw](https://github.com/jeffalstott/powerlaw/tree/master).

Here, we are instead interested in modelling a response variable as a function of a predictor variable by finding the best functional approximation. In this context, we are fitting power law functions to known functions, which is closer to the realm of approximation theory and deterministic modelling as opposed to probabilistic (or stochastic) modelling approaches.
